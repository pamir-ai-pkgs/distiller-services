Description: Modern async WiFi provisioning system for Distiller
 Unified async Python application for WiFi provisioning on Raspberry Pi CM5
 devices with e-ink displays.
 .
 Features:
  * Single service architecture with FastAPI and async/await
  * WebSocket real-time updates and session management
  * Persistent mDNS advertising during network transitions
  * Persistent device identity across restarts
  * Monochrome UI with clean, modern design
  * E-ink display support with QR codes
  * Pinggy tunnel with automatic rotation (anonymous, no auth required)
  * Always starts in AP mode for easy setup
  * System hostname and /etc/hosts configuration
  * File logging with rotation to /var/log/distiller/
  * Automatic Avahi daemon restart for proper mDNS
 .
 The system provides seamless transitions between AP and client modes
 without dropping user connections, using modern Python async patterns
 throughout.
