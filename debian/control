Description: WiFi setup and network management for Raspberry Pi CM5 Distiller devices
 This package provides automated WiFi configuration services for Raspberry Pi
 CM5-based Distiller devices. It includes:
 .
  * WiFi hotspot creation for initial device setup
  * Web-based interface for network configuration
  * E-ink display integration for visual feedback
  * mDNS service discovery for permanent device access
  * SSH tunnel management through Pinggy
 .
 The service creates a seamless WiFi setup experience by automatically creating
 a temporary WiFi hotspot, providing a web interface for network selection and
 authentication, and transitioning to permanent network access after successful
 connection.
 .
 This package is designed for Raspberry Pi CM5 devices running on arm64
 architecture, but is compatible with all architectures.
 .
 Python dependencies are installed via pip in a virtual environment during
 package installation to ensure compatibility across different Debian versions.
